	<b><p>COSC 112                  Computer Science I (Fall, Spring)                                        4 Credits</p></b>

<b><p>Prerequisite: None. (Students without programming experience may be advised to take COSC 111 before or concurrently with COSC 112.) This course is a study of the formal syntax and semantics of a programming language.  Topics include expressions, assignments, declarations, control structures, arrays, data abstractions, subprograms, user interfaces, error handling, end of file handling, and string handling.  Aspects of Software Engineering include top down design, structured programming, and style in programming conducted in a block structured language, such as Pascal, C, or C++.  Ethical and social issues include information privacy, data reliability, data security, including wiretapping and encryption and ergonomics.  This course may be used to satisfy the General Education Requirement in the Technology category.</p></b>
